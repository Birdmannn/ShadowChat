# Contribution Rules

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Please read the following rules carefully before applying to work on an issue.

## Application Process

When applying to work on an issue:

1. Provide a brief background about yourself.
2. Explain how you plan to approach the issue.
3. Share your estimated time of arrival (ETA) for completing the task.

## Deadlines and Communication

- If you cannot complete the task within your ETA + 1 day, **you must inform me** on Telegram (@SoarinSkySagar). Failure to do so will result in you being unassigned from the issue.
- Contributors can reach out for help regarding the project anytime via:
  - Maintainer's Telegram: [@SoarinSkySagar](https://t.me/SoarinSkySagar), [@Sudipta_31](https://t.me/sudipta_31)
  - Project Telegram: [Shadow Chat](https://t.me/shadowchat_od)
  - Our project's Telegram group.

## Workflow Requirements

1. **Work on a Separate Branch**
   - Always create a new branch for your work and submit your pull requests (PRs) from there.

2. **Run Checks Before Submitting a PR**
   - Make sure to run the following command in the root directory:
     ```bash
     npm run check
     ```
   - Ensure there are no errors before submitting your PR.

3. **PR Validation**
   - If any checks fail on your PR, you must fix them before it can be merged.
   - The only exception is **Vercel deployments**, which require my authorization.

## Project Setup

Refer to the [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) file in the same directory for detailed instructions on setting up the project.

By following these guidelines, you help ensure a smooth contribution process for everyone involved. Thank you for contributing!
